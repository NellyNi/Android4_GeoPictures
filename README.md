I copied the apk-release file in the folder. My ten images, which from the course website, are saved in my device's Download folder.My red markers would not show on the map when developer re-run the Android Studio. I did the Extra Credit part. The photos are saved external after take picture and press OK. And they could be shown after click their own certain green markers. There can be multiple green markers.
